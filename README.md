# fcs-korp-endpoint
The Korp fcs 2.0 reference endpoint implementation.

## Quick start

Call `mvn clean compile war:war` to create a war file.  
Use `mvn clean package` to do a full build with tests, war, sources and javadoc. Ensure that `$JAVA_HOME` is correctly set.

There are though some configurations to change if you want to use it with your own Korp service.
